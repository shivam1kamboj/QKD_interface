To make quantum key distribution (QKD) more accessible, I developed a web-based simulation using Flask and HTML/JavaScript, with Cirq handling quantum circuit simulations in the backend.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/shivam1kamboj/QKD_interface.git)
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Navigate to directory QKD_interface
4. Run `python app.py` in your terminal to start the Flask server

The Jupyter file QKD.ipynb in this project is used for debugging. You can either discard this file or use it to take this QKD project to next level.
